- 👋 Hi, I’m @RedCode999
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Design and Development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the workings of Unreal Engine 5 and Max2d. This includes the scripting languages, but also a little bit of art design on the side. 
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any game jams where anyone needs an extra set of hands.
- You can chat to me about personal projects too. Maybe I can help in some way.
- 📫 You can find me over at itch.io under RedCode999 and on instagram under RedBriers. Feel free to message me wherever.
